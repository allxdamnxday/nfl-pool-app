        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Laws</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These are very simple. You select one NFL team to win each week STRAIGHT UP, NO SPREADS. If the team you select wins, you stay in the pool for another week. If the team you select loses or ties, well, thanks for the $60 contribution and there is always next year. The one catch that makes this a little more difficult is that you cannot use the same team twice during the regular season.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          For example, if you choose the Las Vegas Raiders in Week #1, and by some miracle they win, you cannot use them again for the rest of the regular season. You must understand - the team you choose must win for you to move on and stay in the pool. A TIE IS CONSIDERED A LOSS, or not a win, whichever helps it sink in. Also, you cannot pick a team with a bye week to avoid a loss.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Deadline for Picks</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Picks are due by 1:00 PM PDT Sunday. THERE ARE NO LONGER DEFAULT PICKS. IF YOU DO NOT SELECT A PICK BY THIS TIME, YOU FORFEIT THAT PICK. We will monitor fringe cases, errors, and make exceptions at the commissioner&apos;s discretion if a pick does not go through. Please forward any errors with a screenshot to support@footballeliminator.com. This is a new rule for this season. We now allow you to preset picks all the way through week 18. We strongly encourage you to take advantage of this feature, be strategic about your picks early, and make adjustments as needed up to game time each week.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Weekly Picks & Results</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Weekly picks and results will be published on Tuesdays so that participants can see pool health and be strategic about modifying their picks for future weeks.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Prize Purse</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The number of entries times $60.00 less small % kept by the commissioner will determine the total pot. We are assessing this fee for the 2024-2025 season to cover remodel costs and make the game easier and more fun. Future entry fees and percentages to the commissioner will be decided in later seasons. The total pot will be paid to the lone survivor or unless all surviving contestants get eliminated in that particular week, then the pot will be split evenly between them.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          At any time during the season, the pot can be split between the remaining survivors if all remaining survivors come to an agreement. If the regular season is completed with multiple survivors, then 20% of the prize purse will be divided equally between the remaining entries who successfully managed picking correctly for all 18 weeks of the NFL regular season and survived. The remaining 80% will be played for, by these survivors, during the playoffs and the Big Game...and this can be quite challenging.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Playoff Rules</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          For those survivors that correctly picked all 18 weeks of the NFL regular season, and if more than one stands, then the pool continues into the playoffs. All NFL teams that make the playoffs will be available to pick regardless of if you used them during the regular season, but can still be used only once during the playoffs and The Big Game. This is a bit tricky, because you have to have a team available to use in The Big Game (if it goes that far) to be able to get a win. No team available to use constitutes a loss. If there is still more than 1 entry alive after the Big Game, then the remaining pot will be split evenly. If on any given playoff week, all entries are eliminated, the pot is also split evenly between those entries.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          For playoff rule purposes; if you pick correctly but do not have a team available for the following week, you are not eliminated until the following week. Which means, for example, if there are 3 entries left during a playoff weekend and 2 suffer losses and 1 wins but doesn&apos;t have a team to use the following week, that winning pick wins the pool because they don&apos;t technically get eliminated until the following week.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">COVID, Monkey Pox, or any other pandemic the WHO, CDC, or FDA comes up with Contingency Plan</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If the season is cancelled before the first full week of regular season games is played or completed, all entry money will be returned to you in the form it was delivered to me (Zelle in = Zelle out, Check in = Check out, etc.).  And what I mean by full-week schedule, is if the NFL plays the opening Thursday game and Sundays games, but doesn&apos;t complete the Monday game for that schedule week, it is not a complete week of completed games. If games are cancelled/postponed/forfeited during any schedule week and the NFL resumes the following schedule week, the previous schedule week will then be considered completed.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If the season is cancelled in weeks 2-18, all entries still alive will receive an equal share of the pot with payout coming to those entries in the form the entry fee was delivered to me. We will use the last COMPLETED week to determine what entries are still alive.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If the season gets postponed with plans to complete at a later date, all survivors will continue until the season is either resumed or cancelled. If they shorten the season and use some form of expanded playoff, we will use the current pool playoff rule format with every surviving entry to that point able to use any playoff team regardless of whether they used them during the regular season.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If during the season, NFL virus/disease testing determines a team(s) cannot play on any given week, and the game for that week is either forfeited, postponed or cancelled, you must choose another game from your available roster. If no other game is available, you forfeit that pick. It is up to you to keep up on current NFL news to ensure you are picking games during regular scheduling. In instances of multiple postponements, we will make exceptions and modify picks retroactively.

          Matthew Swartz â€“ Eldest son of the longtime commissioner, Eric Swartz and a disgruntled Chargers fan. I tend to speak out against things I don&apos;t like. Like Dean Spanos or all things Chiefs and Pat Mahomes (aka Kermit the Frog) related. I have my dad&apos;s dry sense of humor, so I promise I&apos;m not trying to offend anyone. But since you already know that about him, I&apos;ll spare you any further explanation.

        <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Founded by Jim Thomas in 2000, the original pool had 91 entrants and a total prize pool of $1,820.00. That year, it took only 7 weeks to eliminate everyone with the final 27 going out at the same time, splitting the pot and taking home a cool $67.40 each.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-6 text-purple-500">Where the Pool is Today</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Strictly building on word-of-mouth, the pool has seen as many as 1,187 entries in 2018. Even though COVID made many of you skeptical a season could be pulled off, we still managed 787 entries for 2020. In 2021, we ended up with 1,002 entries for a total prize pool of $40,080. In 2022 we had a then record number of entries; 1,277 and a record pot of $51,080. In 2023, we reached another high with 1,332 entries and a record prize pool of $53,280!!!

          WE HOPE 2024 WILL BE OUR BIGGEST POOL YET!
